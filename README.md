# Hammerspoon configuration

My configuration for [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org).

# Features

- A Zettelkasten workflow for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) for hotkeys and getting selection).
- A modal tiling window manager (very much like [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/) or [Lasso](https://www.thelasso.app)).

# Note

Implemented with [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex).
